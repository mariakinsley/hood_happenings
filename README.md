#Neighborly

Neighborly is a mobile responsive web app made by Sarah Niemiec and Maria Kinsley. Inspired by seeing posters for lost dogs and rummage sales we thought there must be a better way, so Neighborly was born. Neighborly allows users to create events for their area and post them to the calendar where you can see all the events for that location. The events maps page shows all the current and future events which links you to their respective pages for more details. There is a lost and found, also divided by location. Users can contact the user who made the lost/found post using the sendgrid api to send them an email.
